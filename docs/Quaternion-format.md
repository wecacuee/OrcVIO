The quaternion format used is Hamilton, with the scalar in the last position. This format is also used in

- EuRoC dataset 
- TUM RGBD dataset 

For EuRoC dataset, in the [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291954561_The_EuRoC_micro_aerial_vehicle_datasets) it says it's using Hamilton quaternion, format is `time(ns), px, py, pz, qw, qx, qy, qz`.
